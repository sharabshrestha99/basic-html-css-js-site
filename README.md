# Basic Static Website

This is a minimal, static website built with **semantic HTML**, **CSS**, and a small amount of **JavaScript**. It is intentionally simple and clean, suitable as a starting point for beginners or as a lightweight template.

## Structure

```

/basic-html-css-js-site
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── README.md

```

## Features

- Semantic HTML5 layout (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
- Responsive navigation using Flexbox
- Mobile-friendly layout via media queries
- Lightweight JavaScript for basic interactivity
- No external dependencies

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Edit content directly in the HTML files.
4. Customize styles in `style.css`.
5. Add or extend behavior in `script.js`.

## Notes (Mentor Reality Check)

- This is **not** production-grade. There is no build system, no accessibility tuning, no performance optimization, and no SEO strategy.
- If you plan to scale this, introduce:
  - Proper accessibility (ARIA, contrast checks)
  - Asset minification
  - A component or framework strategy
- As-is, this is a solid _foundation_, not a finished product.
